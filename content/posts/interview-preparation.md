- Get ready with 3 projects (or, startup) ideas that could be helpful to people. Make sure they should not be in your resume. You would be asked to describe the complete technical aspect of the Project. (A possible hack, is to copy the idea of a very early stage startup and present that. Make sure the idea must not be popular enough to be known by the interviewer.)
